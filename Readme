scRNA-seq Processing Pipeline (WSU Grid – Nov 2025)
Project Overview

This repository documents the complete preprocessing pipeline for mouse single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data generated in November 2025.

It covers:

FASTQ transfer & organization

QC with FastQC

Alignment & count matrix generation using Cell Ranger 7.0.0

HPC job submission on WSU Grid

Reproducible scripts for future runs

This repository is designed for full transparency and reproducibility of the computational workflow.

Dataset includes four mouse scRNA-seq samples:

855_S1

857_S2

S1_S3

S3_S4

Each sample contains:

Paired-end reads: R1, R2

Sample indices: I1, I2

Two lanes (L001, L002)
